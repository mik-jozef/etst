# Source code for (Ta)BSTiaT-vL

This repository contains the Latex source code for the document.
To compile the pdf at [Overleaf](overleaf.com), copy the files `bib.bib`
and `main.tex` to an empty project and you're done.

A sometimes-updated version of the pdf in in the file `etst.pdf`.

## Compiling locally
I have no idea how to do this, nor do I care. I guess `pdflatex`
should work out of the box, though.
